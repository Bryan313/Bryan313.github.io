## About me
#### My name is Bryan Lee Williams I was born in Manama,Bahrain and grew up in the military child life style so I don't really know where I call my home town. But, I spent the majority o fmy childhood in Houston, Texas with my grandmother on my moms sode of the family. It was a nice experience but I think I enjoy living oversea more because it's much safer and friendlier. 

## I like watching college wreslting
